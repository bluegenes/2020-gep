## Troubleshooting strategically
 - strategic troubleshooting? troubleshooting strategies? workflow troubleshooting? other better title?

The nature of research software (including workflow system software) means that it is often undergoing its own iterative development process to better address the research questions and user needs at hand.
For users, this can be an incredible advantage.
Tools under active development are likely to improve software efficiency, add new features, improve user interaction and documentation, and be responsive to queries.
However, functionality may change as developers build their software, and despite best efforts, documentation can get out of date [@doi:10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1].
On top of this, it is difficult to grok code and usage errors while unfamiliar with a tool or its underlying language or syntax, especially for researchers without computational training [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005755].
As a result, workflows will invariably require troubleshooting and iteration, often even while running test datasets associated with analysis software.
The challenges of learning and interacting with research software -- from coding languages to workflow systems to analysis -- require time and patience, and it is important to approach your work with this in mind [@doi:10.1139/facets-2019-0020].
One of the largest barriers is learning how, when, and where to ask for help.
Below we outline a strategy for troubleshooting that can help build your own knowledge while respecting both your own time and that of research software developers and the larger bioinformatic community.

### How to help yourself: Try to pinpoint your issue or error

The first step, of course, is to try to narrow down the source of your error.
First - are you (or did you try) running the example or test data, using their exact code?
It is critical to know that the software works on your system before trying to use your own data and modifications.
Most of the time, the software will emit an error message with information that will help you understand the issue you triggered.
If there is no error message or it is not clear, first run the software's help (usually accessible on the command line via `tool-name --help`) to check that you've specified all the arguments with the correct syntax.
Syntax errors are extremely easy to make, and typos as small as a single, difficult to spot, misplaced character can affect the code.
Then look to the program's documentation, which will usually contain additional information and use case examples. Note that if there is a syntax discrepancy between the `--help` message and official documentation, the `--help` message is more likely to be correct, as it is tied to the codebase itself. Some documentation can be generated directly from code, but most is written separately by software developers, and is more likely to get out of date.
Best practices for software development follow "semantic versioning" principles, which aim to keep the arguments and functionality the same for all minor releases of the program (e.g. 1.1 to 1.2) and only change functions with major releases (e.g. 1.x to 2.0).
Pay attention to the version information (often accessible at the command line `tool-name --version`), and ensure that the syntax you are using is accurate for the program version.

Once you've verified that your syntax is correct, it's time to look further into the error message.
In many cases, the error you've encountered has been encountered many times before, and properly searching for the error online can turn up a working solution.
If there is a GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket issue tracker for the software, a Gitter or google groups page, or any other online community and resources for the tool, search there first with the error code or informative text.
If nothing comes up, escalate to googling the error, but note that the search terms you choose are very important.
At minimum, you'll want to include the name of the program, and the relevant error code or informative text.
Try several variants, and iteratively add information such as the field or type of analysis you're doing, the name of the coding language or computational platform, and other relevant information.
There are a vast array of online resources for bioinformatic help ranging from question sites such as Stack Overflow and BioStars, to personal or academic blogs and even tutorials and lessons written by experts in the field [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002216].
Be sure to follow a few potentially informative links to see whether or not they contain a solution.
As you develop a sense for how to google errors, you may find that this is your best line of defense against errors/ best point of attack for troubleshooting!

### How to seek help: include the right details with your question


It helps to gather the following information together before seeking help: 1. the exact code you used to

If there is an error code, or useful text, you'll want to

the next step is to look for help in local and online communities.


- try to figure out the exact conditions that produced your error == narrow your question down. This helps others help you, and may sometimes even lead  you to solve the whole thing yourself

If you have tried the strategies above and are having trouble with your workflow, it's time to ask for help.

The first point of attack is always to Google the error, including any identifying error message or code, the program name, and if necessary, the type of data you're running.


If you can't find any solutions in the relevant search results, it's time to escalate.
If the error is with a specific program, it's best to post on that program's help or issue location (e.g. GitHub Issues), or google group mailing list.



- once you've done this legwork, if your issue hasn't resolved itself, it's time to reach out.
- when asking for help, it's essential to provide the right details... (which are: software, version, code, etc)
- putting the effort into the bits above shows respect for the community and helpers, and makes it 1. easier/faster for people to solve your issue, 2. increases your own understanding of the issues itself and the program.

Often the authors of your software will post their preferred location for answering questions and solving errors related to their program.
Be sure to include the relevant details of your error, including terminal output and the version of the software you are using.
 If your error or question is more general, such as asking about program choice or workflows, Stack Overflow is a good choice.
First, search through related topics to ensure your question has not already been answered.
If it hasn't, make a post to a relevant section, and be sure to include all relevant information in your post - type of data you have, approaches you've tried already, relevant error message, etc.


### Where to seek help: local and online communities of practice

Building a local community of practice [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2005561]
As more research software development is happening openly in online repositories such as GitHub...

...  carpentries/ etc have been trying to build communities with good code of conduct!

working to foster an active, inclusive, and diverse community for data-intensive biology.

of learners and instructors that promotes and models the importance of software and data in research

-  local communities: many benefits!

- online forums and communities: also can be awesome. here's where to start! (stackoverflow, etc)


While there is lots of help available online, there's no substitute for local communities where you can get help working with your data and learning to troubleshoot.
Many people around you may be experiencing similar issues and finding it difficult to find appropriate help.
Developing a local bioinformatics community, either via seminar series or meetup sessions for data analysis, can also help in both improving and expanding your work in this area.
Once you establish a local community, it may also be useful to set up a local online sites (e.g. discourse) for group troubleshooting.
While this may seem like just a local version of Stack Overflow, the local, member-only nature can help create a safe and collaborative online space for troubleshooting problems often encountered by your local bioinformatics community.
The benefit to beginners is clear: learning the best way to post questions and the important parts of errors, while getting their questions answered so they can move forward in their research.
However, intermediate users may find these communities most useful, as they can also accelerate their own troubleshooting skills by helping others solve issues that they have already struggled through.
While it can be helpful to have some experts available to help answer questions or to know when to escalate to Stack Overflow or other communities, a collaborative community of practice with members at all experience levels can help all its members move their science forward faster.
