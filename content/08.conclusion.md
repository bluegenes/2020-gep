## Conclusion

Bioinformatics-focused workflow systems have revolutionized data-intensive biology, and enabled biologists to cope with the massive scale of data now becoming available.
Workflow-integrated software management tools remove tool installation as a barrier to data exploration and analysis, and free biologists to less time rewriting common analysis steps, and spend more time on interesting biological questions.
With a few directed strategies for project, data, and resource management, these workflow systems can quickly streamline bioinformatic analyses and reduce the time to insight.
We hope the tips contained here will enable more biologists take advantage of workflow-enabled data-intensive biology.
