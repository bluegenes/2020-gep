## Conclusion

Bioinformatics-focused workflow systems have reshaped data-intensive biology, reducing execution hurdles and empowering biologists to conduct reproducible analyses at the massive scale of data now available.
Shared, interoperable research code is enabling biologists to spend less time rewriting common analysis steps, and more time on interesting biological questions.
With this manuscript, we have attempted to provide a directed set of "good enough" project, data, and resource management strategies sufficient for adopting workflow systems to facilitate and expedite reproducible biological research.
Although we specifically included data management strategies tailored to our own experiences in high-throughput sequencing analysis, we hope that these principles enable biologists both within and beyond our field to reap the benefits of workflow-enabled data-intensive biology.
