## Author Summary {.page_break_before}

We present a guide for workflow-enabled biological sequence data analysis, developed through our own teaching, training and analysis projects. We recognize that this is based on our own use cases and experiences, but we hope that our guide will contribute to a larger discussion within the open source and open science communities and lead to more comprehensive resources.
Our main goal is to accelerate the research of scientists conducting sequence analyses by introducing them to organized workflow practices that not only benefit their own research but also facilitate open and reproducible science.
