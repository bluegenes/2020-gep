## Author Summary {.page_break_before}

In this paper, we present our guide for biological sequence data analysis, developed through our own teaching, training and analysis. We recognize that this is currently biased towards our own use casea nd experiences, but we hope to engage in robust discussion with the open source community in order in include the best set of practices.

Our main goal is to accelerate scientists conducting sequence analyses into organized workflow practices that benefit their own research while also facilitating open and reproducible science.
