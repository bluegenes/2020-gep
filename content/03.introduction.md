## Introduction

Sequencing data are now widely available for species across the tree of life, and new sequencing data continues to be generated at an incredible rate [@url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sragrowth/].
The wealth of information present in high-throughput sequencing data has already revolutionized our understanding of the diversity and function of organisms and communities, building basic understanding from ecosystems to human health.

As sequencing analysis has matured over the past decade, several papers have presented "best" or "good enough" practices for computational biological analyses [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002303; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510].
These recommendations have both helped build consensus and fueled additional tool and workflow development.
Since the latest paper in 2017 [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510],  key advancements in workflow scripting, software management, and tools that handle biological data at scale have vastly increased the power of analysis management.
In particular, the emergence of bioinformatics-focused workflow systems has empowered biologists to analyze biological data at scale.

Bioinformatics-focused workflow systems and software management tools contain powerful infrastructure for task and tool management and can self-monitor progress, resource usage, and dependencies.
When paired with proper software management, fully-contained workflows are scaleable, robust to software updates, and executable across platforms.
These workflow systems have quickly become the workhorses of modern bioinformatics, enabling researchers to build workflows that execute dozens of analysis tools in a systematic manner across all experimental samples, producing hundreds to thousands of intermediate files for a single analysis.
In concert, sharing of data analysis lessons and workflows has created a critical mass of analysis code now openly available for research and training, including that done by nonprofit organizations such as the Carpentries [@doi:10.2218/ijdc.v10i1.351].

In our experiences with both research and training biologists in computational techniques, workflow systems have greatly reduced the barrier to entry for data analysis at scale and opened the door to end-to-end reproducible analyses.
Here, we present some tools, strategies, and "good enough" practices for leveraging workflow systems to streamline data-intensive biology and to enhance the documentation, automation and reproducibility of your science.
