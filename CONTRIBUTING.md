## What to Contribute

We're looking for contributors from a variety of backgrounds -- not just biologists and other scientists interested in reading and synthesizing the literature, but people with experience running collaborative literature reviews or managing large projects in GitHub have also been extremely helpful.

To look for ideas of what is currently needed, check [here](https://github.com/bluegenes/2020-gep/issues/2) or look through the open [Issues](https://github.com/bluegenes/2020-gep/issues) until you find a topic that interests you.

## First Step

First, go [here](https://github.com/bluegenes/2020-gep/issues/1) and tell us a bit about yourself per the questions at the top.

## How to Contribute Text

1. First, go [here](https://github.com/bluegenes/2020-gep/issues/1) and tell us a bit about yourself. 
2. Then, you can look through the [current document](https://bluegenes.github.io/2020-gep/) or at each section in the [content](./content) folder.
3. To contribute suggestions or changes, beginners should follow [these instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md).
Experienced git users can find a suggested workflow and manubot build instructions [here](INSTRUCTIONS.md#command-line-users).

[Click here](https://github.com/bluegenens/2020-gep/blob/master/USAGE.md#manuscript-metadata) for formatting instructions.

Once the answer to the question "did you change the contents of the repository in some way that was meaningful (i.e., not just adding an apostrophe or fixing typos)?" is yes, please add yourself to the author list by following the Authorship Guidelines below.

## Reviewing Someone's Pull Request

Reviewing text that other contributors submit is one of the most important ways you can help.
Because we are all coming from different fields, there is value in having as many people as possible look at each submission to help new ideas percolate.
Right now, we are asking for at least two people to look at each new piece of text.
Some things you can check for when you review someone's pull request:
- Does it pass all manubot checks? ([See here for more information](https://github.com/bluegenes/2020-gep/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md#how-can-i-see-my-change))
- To the extent that the text overlaps with your own area of expertise, is it correct? 
Are there any ambiguities, oversimplifications, or topics you think should be clarified?
- Do you have questions about any of the content inside or outside of your field?
- Will the text be easy for someone from a different scientific discipline to understand?

If you have questions about the topic broadly and how it may relate to other sections of the paper, etc., you are encouraged to open an issue and start this discussion!
You can tag a PR in an issue by typing "\#" and the number of the PR (beside the title). 
(For example, #100 will call up the PR that added a a code of conduct).

### The How-To of PR Review

When you open someone's pull request, there are a few ways you can propose suggestions or changes.

Here we will walk you through our preferred method.

**Step One:** Navigate to the "Files" tab so that you can see the changes the user is proposing.

Green highlights the content that this pull request (PR) changes or adds.
These lines also begin with a plus sign (`+`).
Red highlights the content that they have deleted.
These lines also begin with a minus sign (`-`).

**Step Two:** Locate a line where you'd like to suggest a change, hover over it so that a blue "+" appears, and then click the "+"

**Step Three:** Click the page symbol (in blue here) to insert a suggestion

**Step Four:** Propose in-line edits

Anything typed within the code formating block (the section sandwiched between \`\`\`), as in the picture above, will be considered an inline change. 
You can also type a separate comment outside of the code for block (i.e., before the first \`\`\` or after the second \`\`\`).

**Step Five:** Click the green "Start a Review" button below the comment box to finalize your suggestion (although you can go back and edit it by clicking the three dots next the smiley face that you'll see beside the proposed change in the image for step 6).
Starting a Review means that all of your suggestions will be grouped together for easier viewing -- we encourage this!
Now repeat steps 2-4 for all of the changes you'd like to propose.

**Step Six:** When you're finished proposing changes, click the large green "Finish Your Review" in the upper right corner.

Thank you for reviewing a submission! 
If you have questions about this tutorial, please open an issue to let us know what's confusing.


## Authorship Guidelines

We're using the [ICMJE Guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html) for determining authorship.
To add yourself to the author list following a meaningful contribution to the repository, please:
1. Look up the [CRediT Taxonomy](https://casrai.org/credit/) and determine which Contributor Role(s) best characterizes your contribution.
(You can always update this later if you take on more responsibilities)
2. Fill in your [author information](USAGE.md#manuscript-metadata) by initiating a [pull request](INSTRUCTIONS.md#how-to-contribute) on [this file](content/metadata.yaml)
